This plan outlines the architecture for a new web application that will be hosted on a cloud server. The architecture includes a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic, multiple web servers to handle requests, a database server to store data, and a caching server to improve performance.

To confirm its viability, we need to consider factors such as scalability, reliability, security, and performance. We should also ensure that the chosen technologies and configurations are compatible with each other and meet the requirements of the application.

Additional information such as expected traffic volume, expected data storage requirements, and budget constraints would be helpful in evaluating the viability of this architecture plan.
